```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

### BUSINESS OBJECTIVE

I am using R to fully explore the data available from Twitter to help a small business understand how to be more effective in their outreach.  I am using statistical analysis and Natural Language Programming to accomplish this.

I am using one of my own Twitter Accounts in order to explore the data available to any small business.


### NECESSARY LIBRARIES
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

```


#DATA IMPORT
```{r}
TwitterData = read_csv('TwitterData.csv')
dat = TwitterData
```


### Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
